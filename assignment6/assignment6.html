      <p class="p1"> I was motivated to attend college because I knew it was the only way I can make it in life. It ’s not a plan B for me. When you are a black female you have to work twice as hard as anyone else. I worked really hard to get here. I will finish school. I will get a degree. I have little sisters and brothers that look up to me. I want to say I made it, and they can do it too. I really want a   life better, I don’t want to stay in the hood. I want to give my mother a better life and getting my degree will do so much good. This is what motivated me to attend college. Plus I want to make a mark in the world and being in college is just apart of the process.  Wanting better for myself giving me the push that I need to be in school. When I was growing up a lot of people said I was not going to make it. When you have that many people telling you so many negative things you start to believe it. That’s why I’m here when someone tells me I can’t do something I show them different. I don’t want to be another statistic, I want to beat the odds.

      <p class=p2>I want to study Psychology because I want to know how the human brain works, what makes people do the thing they do. I was always interested in what makes people snap or go over the edge. Just this summer some kids I grew up with killed a man, They burned him alive and ran him over with a car.  I want to know why would they take someone's life in that way or even take somebody's life at all.I have so many questions, was it for love, is love that strong to make you kill someone? Is it the hate in someone's heart for the other person? This is why I am studying psychology, Psychology is going to answer my questions on how and why things happen. Why do you black out or kill someone what translation in your brain think it’s okay, or what was your motive? I want to know the brain. Another thing that made me gravitate towards psychology is multiple personalities. What makes your brain split up into some many parts? My favorite book is pretty girl 13. It’s about a young girl come back to her family and have a very dramatic thing happen to her and to cope and stay alive she had to be a different person when it came to specific things.
