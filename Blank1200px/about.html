<h2>How it started</h2>
<p>
  started my nail business with only $100. I got all my product off of amazon. I wasn't great at first so I start watching youtube videos to learn more so I could get better at my craft. For me it was more of a mental thing before a action thing. One thing I learned about starting something new is that it takes time and practice. I feel like it's all about investing in yourself when it comes to starting a business you have to take a risk.

<h2>how it's going?</h2>
<p>
  It's going good for the most part I learned a lot about the nail world and also learned a lot about myself as well while I am on this journey. My first nail set was horrible. But I kept going I didn't let that one nails set determine my life for my nail career for that matter. For my the nails world change almost every 3-4 month deepening on the new things that comes out and that people like.
