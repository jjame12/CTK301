<p>Keep nails clean and dry Cut nails straight across
Keep nails shaped and free of snags by filing with an emery board.
Do not bite fingernails or remove the cuticle
Do not use your nails as a tool, such as openingIan Mackaye is a songwriter, record producer, and co-founder of Dischord Records.
Ian was born in D.C April 16,1926, he played the piano as a child. Ian was in his first band he performed a song “I drink Milk”  Ian had music in his life ever since he was little. He is worth 5 million. Ian played bass guitar and sang back in the 80’s. Ian is very talented to me. I feel like he is inspirational since he was young when music was in him. Ian made a strong name for himself. One thing is cool to me is that there are so many things that he has going on he made about 5 incomes to make sure he is straight. I love that about him he is known for many things than just one thing.
