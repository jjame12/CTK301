Ian was born in D.C April 16,1926, he played the piano as a child. Ian was in his first band he performed a song “I drink Milk”  Ian had music in his life ever since he was little. He is worth 5 million. Ian played bass guitar and sang back in the 80’s. Ian is very talented to me. I feel like he is inspirational since he was young when music was in him. Ian made a strong name for himself. One thing is cool to me is that there are so many things that he has going on he made about 5 incomes to make sure he is straight. I love that about him he is known for many things than just one thing.
